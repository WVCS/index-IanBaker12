    <h1> OUR STORY </h1>

<b> Baker's Bagels was made in 1950 when a kid named Johnny Baker wanted to open up a bagel shop in San Diego. Johnny opened up a food shack on the side of a road and every morning he would get their at 4am and start cooking bagels till he opened which was at 6am </b>
<b> Johnny started off with getting very little to no costumers everyday. One day that changed. When the most popular bagel shoped in the town got burned down by a fire people had no where to go to eat bagels. Johnny noticed that and made big signs that told everyone he had thje best bagels in town </b>
<b> The nest day after putting up the signs Johnny had huge lines. he ended up hiring his brother Joe to help him. Johnny and Joe would have huge lines a\of people and a line at the door from 7am till they closed at 11am. Baker's Bagels quickley rose as the best Bagel place in San Diego. </b>
<b> Nowadays Baker's Bagels is able to serve hot and fresh Bagels every single day </b>
